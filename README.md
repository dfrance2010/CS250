Software Development Lifecycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by listening to their requests, asking clarifying questions, repeating what they've said, then agreeing on what they want. These steps help me to understand what the user wants and lets them be comfortable that I understand. It would also give the opportunity to provide suggestions for alternative solutions they might not have thought of. Creating user stories helps relay this information to the development team and gives them a clear definitiion of done.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I start with an overall goal in mind, then break it down into manageable milestones. Since taking this course, I've started implementing the "just enough to work" strategy in developing some of my personal apps. This has allowed me to test, start using the functionality, and better envision the next step. I've found it's been very beneficial for me to do my own personal version of sprints. Each time I sit down to work, I have a clear task in mind with a set criteria for what "done" means.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development, in my mind, is the same as being a good team member in any scenario. This includes knowing when to lead, when to follow, when to provide help, when to ask for help, and above all, strong communication. Putting aside ego, personal feelings, or personal aspirations for the good of the team's success will lead to everyone looking good. I've always been a fan of the John Wooden style of plaay, which is put your head down, do your job - whatever that means, and the scoreboard will take care of itself.
